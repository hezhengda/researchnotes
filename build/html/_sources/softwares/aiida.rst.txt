Aiida
=====

`Aiida <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/>`_ is a great tool for managing computational tasks. And it can also be used in high-thoughput computing.

I started learn how to use Aiida in November, 2020, and it suddenly release my burden on how to manage computational tasks. Before Aiida, all the management are done by using folders, which can be really inefficient and chaotic, but with Aiida, I can put everything in one jupyter notebook, then manage all the work, the connection to the supercomputer and also the database in one place.
