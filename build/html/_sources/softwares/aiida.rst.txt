Aiida
=====

`Aiida <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/>`_ is a great tool for managing computational tasks. And it can also be used in high-thoughput computing.

I started learn how to use Aiida in November, 2020, and it suddenly release my burden on how to manage computational tasks. Before Aiida, all the management are done by using folders, which can be really inefficient and chaotic, but with Aiida, I can put everything in one jupyter notebook, then manage all the work, the connection to the supercomputer and also the database in one place.

I have written two tutorial articles about how to install and configure Aiida on `Ubuntu <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/295175866>`_ and `macOS <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/300490416>`_, since I have a Mac, so on macOS could be a better choice since the virtual machine is not as efficient as the main OS.

When we try to learn Aiida or other programming frameworks, the first thing is always: get a demo running. Because you can learn a lot of things by *trial-and-error*
