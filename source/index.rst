Welcome to Zheng-Da He's research notes!
==============================================

In this document I will summarize all the relevant details of my research, and also it can become a central place for storing all the knowledge that I have gained. I think it is really important to share that to other people, because I also have learned a lot from other people's notes. Research is hard, and information can sometimes be overwhelming, so we need to use technology to help us organize them, and I find `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>` is a really good tool.

I will divide all my notes into different categories in below:

* **Projects**: All the projects that I have done, still doing, and will do in the future
* **Softwares**: Different softwares or packages I have used, for each software/package, I will give short introduction, some examples and also some tricks in using them.
* **Theoretical Background**: Without a solid theoretical background, any good research is impossible. So we need to study and re-study the materials that we need. So in here I will summarize my understanding of different subjects: e.g. Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Density Functional Theory, etc.
